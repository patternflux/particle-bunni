We’ve been building this project in the quiet hours—late nights, early mornings, little pockets of time where sound felt like the right thing to follow. Particle Bunni started as a place for experiments, a space to explore textures, motion, and the odd shapes that come out of letting instinct lead.

Somewhere along the way, those sketches grew into an album.
Today we’re releasing Organic Forms & Sonic Shapes into the world.

The album is available now on SoundCloud and Bandcamp, and it will find its way to the rest of the streaming platforms soon. It’s a collection of sonic forms—glitchy edges, warm drones, shifting patterns, small rhythms that stretch out and fold back in on themselves. These pieces came from the same impulse: let sound feel alive, let it carry its own shape, and let it surprise us.

A lot of this project lives in the blurry space between intuition and design. We both brought our own curiosities, our own backgrounds, and our own odd angles to it, and somewhere in the overlap, something new started to emerge. That space is where Particle Bunni feels most at home.

Now the album belongs to whoever finds it. Maybe it becomes a backdrop for late-night work, for quiet mornings, for long walks, or for nothing in particular at all. We made these tracks because they felt like they wanted to exist, and we’re excited to see where they go.

Thanks for listening, supporting, sharing, or simply wandering through the shapes with us. More experiments are on the way.
