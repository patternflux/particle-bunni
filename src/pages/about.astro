    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
    Particle Bunni is an ambient-electronic collaboration between multidisciplinary artists Terrance Stearns and Grayson West.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Blending electronic sound generation, guitar, analog instruments, voice, and field recordings, the project explores the intersection of mysticism, psychoacoustics, and digital folklore. 
      <p>
        
        <p>
      Inspired by ritual sound practices, particle physics, and post-industrial dreamscapes, Particle Bunni transforms stillness into signal — silence into texture.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Based in Seattle, WA, the duo’s work extends through the Discoastal Culture Collective, a growing network of experimental musicians, poets, and visual artists building bridges between digital and physical worlds.
